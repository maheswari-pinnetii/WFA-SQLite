## 🚀 Overview

Stackly Workforce Analytics is a secure, high-performance web application designed for real-time workforce, attendance, productivity, and department-level tracking. Built from the ground up to utilize a single source of truth in **SQLite**, the project employs a role-based access control (RBAC) security paradigm spanning five defined roles: `Admin`, `HR`, `Manager`, `Team Lead`, and `Employee`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (18+), TypeScript, Vite, Redux Toolkit, React Query, Recharts, Vanilla CSS (curated design token system)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, tsx, Socket.IO
- **Database**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3` with full support for migrations and transactional operations)
- **Quality**: Vitest, Playwright

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Seeding & Database setup
Initialize and seed the SQLite database:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 3. Run Development Server
Start the backend Express API and the Vite frontend concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be served locally at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001

## ☁️ SQLite Cloud Integration & Diagnostic Commands

Stackly Workforce Analytics natively supports cloud hosting via **SQLite Cloud**.

### 1. Connection Diagnostic
Verify your SQLite Cloud connection string and credentials at any time by running:
```bash
npm run sqlitecloud:test
```

### 2. Remote Migration & Seeding
Deploy database tables and push local data up to your cloud instance:
```bash
npm run sqlitecloud:migrate
```

## 🔍 Local Database Inspection (DB Browser for SQLite)

For local development and inspection, we recommend using **DB Browser for SQLite** (a desktop GUI client):

1. Download and install **[DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)** on your machine.
2. Run your local server so it generates/populates the local database.
3. Open the application, click **Open Database**, and select the local file: `database/sqlite/wfa.sqlite`.
4. Use the GUI to browse tables, inspect seed data, or execute custom SQL queries directly against your local environment.

## 🛡️ Default Seed Credentials

For rapid verification, the database seeds the following user roles (all sharing the default password `StacklyWFA2026!`):

| Role | Email | Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin@thestackly.com` | Sarah Connor |
| **HR** | `hr@thestackly.com` | Elena Rostova |
| **Manager** | `manager@thestackly.com` | David Sterling |
| **Team Lead** | `lead@thestackly.com` | Marcus Vance |
| **Employee** | `employee@thestackly.com` | Alex Mercer |
